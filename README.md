## 🚀 Gotta Code 'Em All - Backend!

Welcome to the wild world of our game's backend, located in the `Backend/` directory. This is where all the magic happens! Our trusty Node.js uses Express as its Poké Ball to catch all the requests. MongoDB is our Pokédex, storing all the Pokémon data, and Mongoose is our trusty companion, helping us model our Pokémon world.

### Main Dependencies:

- **Axios**: Like a Pokéflute, it wakes up those HTTP requests.
- **Cors**: It's like a HM01 Cut, making sure we can go through different origins.
- **Express**: Our Pokémon Trainer that handles all the server action.
- **Mongoose**: For when we need to evolve our database schemas.

### What's Inside:

- Routes: These are the paths you'll take on your journey.
- Controllers: They're like Gym Leaders, directing the flow of the game.
- Models: The blueprints for all the Pokémon you'll encounter.

## 🎨 Frontend: Where the Magic Happens!

Step into the `Frontend/` directory, where our React app is like a Pokémon Center, healing and managing our user interface. Vite is our Elite Four champion, ensuring everything builds super fast.

### Main Dependencies:

- **React**: It's like our Poké Ball factory, creating all the UI components.
- **Vite**: The speedy bicycle of our build tools.

### What's Inside:

- Pages & Components: The various towns and cities you'll explore.
- Context Providers: They're like HMs, giving our components special abilities.
- Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI: Our fashion designers, making sure our app looks sharp.
